# Beecrowd Solutions in C

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the Beecrowd online judge platform. These solutions were developed in C as part of the coursework for the **Algorithms and Computer Programming** class at the **University of Brasilia (UnB)**.

## Project Structure

Each file in this repository corresponds to a solution for a specific Beecrowd problem. The filenames are structured as follows:


Where `<problem_id>` is the Beecrowd problem identifier.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the solutions, use a C compiler like `gcc`. For example, to compile the solution for a problem with the filename `problem_1001.c`:

```bash
gcc -o problem_1001 problem_1001.c
./problem_1001
